Hello there. I am a PhD candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department at Clemson University. My areas of interest lie in **Formal Methods**, **Deep Learning**, and **Autonomous Controls**. I particularly focus on the verification of Deep Learning models to quantitatively analyze and ensure safety for autonomous applications such as mobile robots and vehicles. I am seeking internship roles starting Summer 2024 in the field of robotics.
