Hello there. I am a PhD candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department at Clemson University. My areas of interest lie in **Formal Methods**, **Deep Learning**, and **Autonomous Controls**. I particularly focus on verifying Deep Learning models for safety, robustness, and fairness. I conduct quantitative analysis of the verification results and develop tools to ensure safety for autonomous applications such as mobile robots and vehicles. I am seeking internship roles starting in the Summer of 2024 in robotics and autonomous vehicles. My skills can be translated to mathematical models and their analysis as well.
